#  Hey 

Thanks for your help! We appreciate your interest in making our project better. 

There's a few things you can do here.

* Help us combine our serverless functions
* Help us combine the node and python app. The python app sends 1 GET request per row of government data to the node app which is not efficient at scale. One app would be much better.



# How To Contribute

* We highly recommend that *before* you fix something, you create or find an issue about it. That way, we can help you out and discuss the parameters of your fix
